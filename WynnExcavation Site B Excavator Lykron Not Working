For people who have started the quest before  it was fixed, they can not update the quest book to the second phase.
When I talk to Excavator Lykron, his messages appear black and he will not update your quest book. 
The quest book will say you've started, but it won't let you continue the quest. 
Some of the people who haven't done it yet ARE able to do it, but anyone who had the quest glitched can NOT. 
Could you please update quest books for the people who's WynnExcavation Site B is broken?
